## ToDoTask project

This project contains the lab10 solution for the ToDoTask assignment. The assignment was developed for the course of Web Application 1 at Politecnico di Torino (2019/2020) by Anna Tranquillini.
It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of the framework.

The routes defined in assignment 10 are:
* /: for the main page
* /add: for showing the modal in the 'insert new Task' mode
* /edit: for showing the modal in the 'edit existing Task' mode
* /$filter: to show filter tasks belonging to different classes (important,private, ..) or projects
* /login: to show the login interface
